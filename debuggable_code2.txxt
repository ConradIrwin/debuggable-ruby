  Debugability â€” the missing quality.

----

Here's a little secret:

    your code doesn't work

[ Just out of interest, how many of you have deployed some code to production without even running it first? ]
[ Ok. And how many of you regretted it? ]

-----

So as we all know, programming is a two-phase process:

1. design and write code
2. make it f**king work

[ When I was just starting out in the programming game, I assumed that once I reached a certain level,
  I'd not need to do step 2 anymore. I don't think I could have been more wrong. ]

-----

What's even more interesting is the distribution of effort between those two steps:

1. design and write code [ ?? % ] 40%
2. make it f**king work [ 100 - ?? % ] 60%

[ This means that programmers are really just debuggers in disguise ]
